# TEMPERATURE-MONITORING-AND-CONTROL-SYSTEM

The project focuses on building a microcontroller-based system to monitor the temperature of an 
environment and control the operation of fans and a buzzer based on the temperature readings. The system 
utilizes an 8051 microcontroller and various peripheral components like an LCD display, motors, and 
sensors to perform the desired tasks. The temperature sensor provides the input, and based on the 
temperature, the system will adjust the fan's speed 

Objective 
The primary objectives of this project are: 
• To monitor the ambient temperature using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and display it on 
an LCD. 
• To control two motors (fans) based on the temperature: one motor operates at normal temperature, 
and the other is activated when the temperature exceeds a threshold. 
• To display different messages on the LCD to indicate the status of the temperature: Normal, High, 
Too High, or Low.
